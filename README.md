Originally created by Cairthenn for Windower, now ported to Ashita v4

# Features
- Uses the fps plugin to automatically disable the frame rate cap during custcenes.
- Note that this affects regular NPC interaction menus.
- You must have the **fps plugin loaded**.
- This may cause undesirable behavior during specific cutscenes. Unload the addon if this happens.
