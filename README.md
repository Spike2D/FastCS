# FastCS
Originally created by Cairthenn for Windower, now ported to Ashita v4

# Features
- Uses the fps plugin to automatically disable the frame rate cap during custcenes.
- Note that this affects regular NPC interaction menus.
- You must have the **fps plugin loaded**.
- This may cause undesirable behavior during specific cutscenes. Unload the addon if this happens.

# Commands
- **/fastcs fps (30|60|uncapped)** - Changes the default FPS after exiting a cutscene.
- **/fastcs frameratedivisor (2|1|0)** - The prefix can be used interchangeably. For example, "fastcs fps 2" will set the default to 30 FPS.
- **/fastcs exclusion (add|remove) "name"** - Adds or removes a target from the exclusions list. Case insensitive.
